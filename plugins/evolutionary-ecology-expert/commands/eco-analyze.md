# Analyze Evolutionary Ecology Expert

Use the evolutionary ecology expert agent to analyze natural selection mechanisms, adaptation processes, and ecological interactions in evolutionary contexts.

## Usage

```
/eco-analyze <expert_name> [ecological_context]
```

## Arguments

- **expert_name** (required): The name of the evolutionary ecology expert or researcher to analyze.
- **ecological_context** (optional): Specific ecological system or focus area:
  - "natural_selection" - Selection mechanisms and patterns
  - "adaptation" - Adaptive processes and constraints
  - "ecological_interactions" - Species interactions and coevolution
  - "experimental_design" - Research methodology and experimental approaches

## Examples

```
/eco-analyze "John Thompson" "ecological_interactions"
/eco-analyze "Peter Grant" "natural_selection"
/eco-analyze "Ruth Shaw" "adaptation"
/eco-analyze "Sara Via" "experimental_design"
```

## What it does

The agent will:

1. **Expert Analysis**: Examine the researcher's contributions to evolutionary ecology theory

2. **Specialized Topics**:
   - Natural selection analysis in natural populations
   - Adaptation mechanism studies
   - Ecological interaction research

3. **Method Evaluation**: Assess experimental designs and field study approaches

4. **Theoretical Integration**: Connect empirical findings to broader evolutionary theory

## Output

The analysis generates a comprehensive report including:
- Expert's theoretical contributions to evolutionary ecology
- Analysis of natural selection evidence and mechanisms
- Assessment of adaptation studies and constraints
- Evaluation of ecological interaction patterns
- Experimental design recommendations
- Integration of field and laboratory approaches
- Relevant literature citations

## Requirements

This command requires the following MCP servers:
- article-mcp (for ecological literature search)
- sequentialthinking (for structured analysis)

## Notes

- Emphasizes empirical evidence from natural populations
- Integrates both theoretical and experimental approaches
- Considers both microevolutionary and macroevolutionary perspectives
- Provides insights for current evolutionary ecology research

## Research Areas Covered

- **Natural Selection**: Measuring selection, fitness landscapes, selective pressures
- **Adaptation**: Genetic basis, constraints, rapid evolution, phenotypic plasticity
- **Ecological Interactions**: Predator-prey dynamics, host-parasite coevolution, mutualisms
- **Experimental Methods**: Field experiments, common garden studies, reciprocal transplants

## Applications

Useful for:
- Designing evolutionary ecology studies
- Understanding current research trends
- Identifying gaps in ecological knowledge
- Developing testable hypotheses
- Planning experimental approaches
