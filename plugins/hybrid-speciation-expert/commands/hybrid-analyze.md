# Analyze Hybrid Speciation Expert

Use the hybrid speciation expert agent to analyze hybridization mechanisms, genomic introgression, and reproductive isolation evolution.

## Usage

```
/hybrid-analyze <expert_name> [focus_area]
```

## Arguments

- **expert_name** (required): The name of the hybrid speciation expert or researcher to analyze.
- **focus_area** (optional): Specific aspect to focus on:
  - "hybridization" - Hybrid zone dynamics
  - "introgression" - Gene flow patterns
  - "reproductive_isolation" - Barrier mechanisms
  - "genomics" - Genomic analysis methods

## Examples

```
/hybrid-analyze "Loren Rieseberg" "sunflower hybridization"
/hybrid-analyze "Michael Arnold" "genomic introgression"
/hybrid-analyze "James Mallet" "butterfly hybrid zones"
```

## What it does

The agent will:

1. **Literature Review**: Search and analyze academic papers on hybrid speciation and related topics

2. **Specialized Analysis**:
   - Hybrid origin analysis and species formation
   - Gene flow mapping and genomic patterns
   - Speciation mechanism consulting

3. **Case Studies**: Examine specific hybrid speciation events and their evolutionary significance

4. **Method Assessment**: Evaluate current methods for detecting and studying hybridization

## Output

The analysis generates a comprehensive report including:
- Expert's contributions to hybrid speciation theory
- Analysis of genomic data and gene flow patterns
- Assessment of reproductive isolation mechanisms
- Practical recommendations for hybrid speciation research
- Academic citations with relevant literature

## Requirements

This command requires the following MCP servers:
- article-mcp (for literature search)
- genome-mcp (for genomic data analysis)

## Notes

- Focuses on empirical evidence from natural and experimental hybrid zones
- Integrates both classical and molecular approaches
- Provides practical insights for current research projects
- Includes critical assessment of methodological approaches
